2D Graphics simple tile-game with input from keyboard. It took me 40h to make in may 2019.
This game mimics simple mechanics from old Sokoban game - you have to move
certain objects to buttons to move to next lvl. Game counts your steppes and
you can restart lvl using space button. Lvls are loaded from txt file.
I didn't have time to put in game things like - reversing time, animations
and music. Maybe i'll add these one day :) 

Game has smooth move and camera follows player.
